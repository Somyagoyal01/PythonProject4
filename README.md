# Factorial Calculator

## Functionality
This Python program calculates the **factorial** of a given number using **recursion**. It follows these steps:

1. Defines a function named `factorial()` that takes an integer as input.
2. Uses a **recursive approach** to compute the factorial:
   - If the number is less than 2, it returns 1.
   - Otherwise, it multiplies the number by the factorial of the number minus one.
3. Takes user input and passes it to the `factorial` function.
4. Displays the resulting factorial.

## Expected Behavior
- If the user inputs `5`, the output will be:
  ```
  Enter your number= 5
  Your factorial is 120
  ```

## Usage
Run the Python script, input an integer when prompted, and the program will return its factorial.

# Mathematical Functions using Math Module

## Functionality
This Python program performs three mathematical operations on a user-input number using Python's built-in `math` module:

1. **Square Root**: Calculates the square root of the number.
2. **Natural Logarithm**: Calculates the logarithm base *e* (natural log).
3. **Sine**: Calculates the sine of the number (interpreted in radians).

## How It Works
- The user is prompted to enter a number.
- Three separate functions are defined and called:
  - `sqrt()` for square root
  - `log()` for natural logarithm
  - `sine()` for the sine function
- Each function prints the corresponding result.

## Expected Behavior
- If the user enters `5`, the output will be something like:
  ```
  2.23606797749979
  1.6094379124341003
  -0.9589242746631385
  ```

## Usage
Run the Python script, input a number when prompted, and the program will display:
- Its square root
- Natural logarithm
- Sine value (in radians)
